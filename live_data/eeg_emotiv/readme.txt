To use the emotiv epoc headset, you'll first need a few other software from emotiv store (those are free, but you'll need to create an account to get them).

1- the control pannel software (it's usefull to check if you are connected to headset anyway) : https://emotiv.com/store/product_72.html
2- mindYourOSC programm : https://emotiv.com/store/product_85.html

What we are going to do is connect the control pannel and mindYourOSC together, and then send data from mindYourOSC to Pure-Data (you can check out the example patch to get and parse the data in pd).
