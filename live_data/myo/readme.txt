There is a processing library for the myo : https://github.com/nok/myo-processing

You'll need 'Myo Connect' and 'Myo Firmware' from Thalmic labs : https://developer.thalmic.com/downloads

So just install both software from Thalmic labs, then install the library for processing as mentionned in the readme of the myo-processing library, and run the examples here to forward your data to Pure-Data !
